                        supply chains over the past decade, small businesses and entrepreneurship have become
                        a holistic and integral part of the contemporary American culture and economy. For relatively
                        little start-up cost, anyone with an idea or talent can create, grow, and export their
                        brand to the rest of the world. This map is designed to display a snapshot of how American
                        businesses exist today, providing a variety of indicators for small businesses as well as
                        some contextual data involving corporations to demonstrate the overall makeup of the American
                        economy.

                      <p class="SubText">The American Small Business model has allowed for anyone to create and nurture a brand for themselves, and if done successfully,
                        can lead to a very fruitful lifestyle and career. This path however often requires both dedication, expertise in one's craft, and arguably even some luck.
                        According to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, <b>20%</b> of small businesses <b>fail</b> in their first year of operation, and <b>50%</b> of them
                        fail after 5 years of operating.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Those who have found success would say the risk is entirely worth it, a plethora of rags-to-riches stories exist in our history. A notable case study within
                        that group however are Americans who identify as a minority, person of color, or reside in a marginalized community. The prospect of creating a small business
                        for themselves can often be a path that leads them out of, or at the very least, mitigate societal inequality and structural oppression they may face. The small business
                        owner may not be powerful enough to continuously lobby congress or vertically integrate every stage of a multi-national supply chain, but they may be powerful enough to end a
                        multi-generational ancestral history of oppression and poverty, which some would say is worth more than an entire monopoly of power.

                      <p class="SubText">The topic of corporations in America is an inherently controversial one, even the data
                        on the map above hints at this. For example, go ahead and try setting the attribute to display the "Percentage of State
                        Businesses that are Small Businesses" and select New York. You will notice that New York stands at the top of the category with
                        99.8% of its businesses designated as a small business. However, if you change the attribute to "Percentage Employed by Small
                        Businesses", you can see that only 50.2% of New York is employed by them. What this is telling us in context is that a very small
                        handful of mega-corporations manage to employ nearly half of the New York's workforce, despite only making up .2% of total businesses
                        (note that this share is also consists of public-sector jobs which is not included in this study).
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        To provide a more global context to this American-centered study, take a look at the graphic to the right that displays where the world's
                        top 1000 companies originate from. Unsurprisingly, the United States has the largest share of these companies with a total of 404, nearly half of
                        the entire list and triple that of the next largest shareholder (China).
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The balance between small businesses and corporations is an important one to maintain. Corporations are often an integral component of those smaller company's supply chains, often acting
                        as manufacturers or as intermediaries between firm and consumer. Too heavy a hand on either side however can lead to logistical inefficiencies
                        or embedded corruption, which arguably is rampant in our current structure.
